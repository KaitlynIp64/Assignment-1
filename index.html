      <h3>“The more I study, the more insatiable do I feel my genius for it to be.” - Ada Lovelace</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, greatly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, called the Analytical Engine. She is often recognized as the 
 first computer programmer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Ada Lovelace, also goes by Ada Byron(her family name), was the only child of poet Lord Byron and mathematician Lady Byron. She was married to William King in 1835. Her children are Viscount Ockham, Anne Blunt and Ralph King-Milbanke.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When Ada was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to meet and befriend Charles Babbage, a British mathematician who was known as "The Father of Computers". She was greatly interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. She met him in June 1833.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with sets of notes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Ada's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program - that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbages's personal notes from the years 1836-1837 contain the first programs for the engine.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>Ada developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Throughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology and mesmerism. After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844, she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical m<p>On November 27, 1852, Lovelace died from uterine cancer. The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor. She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him. She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque, written in Latin, to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.</p>odel for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings. Sadly, she did not acheive this.</p>
